ClearScore Summary
==================

ClearScore is defined as the ratio of the minimum average approval rating to the maximum average approval rating across ethnic groups.

Formula: ClearScore = (Minimum Average Approval Rating) / (Maximum Average Approval Rating)

Minimum Average Approval Rating among ethnic groups: 0.234
Maximum Average Approval Rating among ethnic groups: 0.263
Computed ClearScore: 0.890

Interpretation:
- A ClearScore of 1.0 indicates perfect equality: all ethnic groups have the same average approval rating.
- A ClearScore less than 1.0 indicates disparity among groups, with lower values signaling greater inequality in loan approval fairness.

This metric helps evaluate how evenly the loan approval process treats applicants across different ethnic groups when using a DTI-based approval rating.
